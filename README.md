IT 4830 Web Development 2 Final Project


Project Description:
- Our project is a student dashboard that allows students to easily register, log in, and keep track of their classes. The app allows users to input their assignment information like grade, due date, etc. for each class. All of this information is stored in a database so that students can come back and check where they left off.


Technology Breakdown:
- Node.js: 
- Express:
- Mongoose: Mongoose was used for the database to store all the user information, course information, assignment information, etc.
- Angular: Angular was used for the front end framework and makes developing components easy and maintainable.
