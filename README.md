IT 4830 Web Development 2 Final Project


Project Description:
- Our project is a student dashboard that allows students to easily register, log in, and keep track of their classes. The app allows users to input their assignment information like grade, due date, etc. for each class. All of this information is stored in a database so that students can come back and check where they left off.


Technology Breakdown:
- Node.js: The runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. We use Node.js v14+ for its non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture, making it perfect for building scalable network applications.
- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Express handles routing, middleware integration, and HTTP request/response handling, making it easy to build our RESTful API.
- Mongoose: Mongoose was used for the database to store all the user information, course information, assignment information, etc.
- Angular: Angular was used for the front end framework and makes developing components easy and maintainable.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: We used it to manage our backend deployment pipeline.
- AWS S3: Static hosting of our Angular files.
